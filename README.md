# StartingNotes
add written book(s) into the players inventory on first spawn

## Usage
add a text file into config/StartingNotes where the first line is the author, second is the title, and each line after that represents a page
add a text file called books.txt and type the full filename of your book on a line (so "myBook.txt" for instance)
it now works

if you want to get the book again, you can simply remove the scoreboard tag sn_spawned and then die
